  <h1> Homepage </h1>

  <p> Look below here, we have an HTML anchor, don't forget to make an attribute for it to actually link to something! You'll see the ole familiar blue text with an underfline if you have an href attribute attached to the anchor. </p>

  <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/about"> Click me and goodbye! </a>
  
  <p> Keep in mind anchors are used to link to any kind of resource on the internet not just another HTML doc! </p>

  <p> Now let's look at opening an absolute link in a new tab. (Taking the structure protocol://domain/path) </p>

  <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Click me to open a new tab.</a>

  <p> This one uses a "rel" attribute. Don't forget the noopener value to prevent the opened link gaining access to this webpage! The other value "noreferrer" prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it. For even more security make sure you don't forget the target="_blank". </p></p>

  <p> Now let's look at a relative link (links to pages located on this website).</p>

  <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

  <p> The above link opens another .html file that you have located in the sam e folder as this index.html. Eventually we will make a better directory system. </p>
