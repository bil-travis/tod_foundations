    <h1>About Page</h1>

    <p> To insert an image use the img tag, and then refer to either a local image as done below.</p>

    <img src="../images/dog.jpg" height="310">

    <p> Or you can link to an absolute image. Besides the src attribute (used to include the image), there is also an alt attribute which is used to describe the image when it can not load.</p>

    <img src="http://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" width="310">

    <p> Go ahead and resize the image using the height and width attributes. The size will be specified in pixels.</p>

    <p> Testing up a gif and trying it out mid paragraph because why not <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt="Mochi Gif">. Idk man let's hope for the best.</p>
