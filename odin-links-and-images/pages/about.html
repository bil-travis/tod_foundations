    <p> To insert an image use the img tag, and then refer to either a local image as done below.</p>

    <img src="../images/dog.jpg">

    <p> Or you can link to an absolute image. Besides the src attribute (used to include the image), there is also an alt attribute which is used to describe the image when it can not load.</p>

    <img src="http://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" wdith="310">
